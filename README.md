# gdlevelconverter-web

A web-based wrapper over my [gdlevelconverter](https://github.com/qimiko/gdlevelconverter).  
Designed as a static webpage to be hosted on GitHub pages. You can find that link [here](https://qimiko.github.io/gdlevelconverter-web/).

Due to a lack of GD server support, level uploading/downloading is not supported.

Uses [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) to interface with the main conversion script.

Site icon uses textures from Geometry Dash.
